Create a fear of missing out or urgency on your site or build a coming soon page with Gutenberg Countdown Block.

== Description ==

Create a fear of missing out a special offer or draw attention to your upcoming events or create a feeling of urgency using the Countdown Block for Gutenberg editor. You can also build a coming soon page to let your visitors know how much time is left to launch.

Once the time is over you can set the timer to disappear from the page, or it can be replaced by a message, or redirect to custom URL.

## Evergreen Countdown Timer ##
Evergreen timer means all visitors get the same time frame, regardless of when they enter the page. It means if,
 - User A visits the page today, he sees a countdown of 2 hours.
 - User B visits two weeks later, she still sees a countdown of 2 hours. 

A cookie is set in the visitor's browser once he lands on the page with the countdown. If the visitor lands on the page next time, the timer will continue from the same time the visitor first landed on the page.

This is the best way to create or increase urgency when promoting sales, events, or other time-limited offers or discounts.

## Fixed Countdown Timer ##
Fixed timer is designed to promote offers or an event on a specific day. You can use the fixed timer to draw attention of your audience to your upcoming events. Or build a coming soon page with fixed timer to let your visitors know when the time left to launch the site or product. Or use it for your Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Christmas, or New Year offers. 

## Actions When Countdown Ends ##
You can simply set a custom action to run once the timer reaches zero.

 - Hide the countdown timer
 - Set a custom page or URL to redirect your visitors
 - Show a message
